ABSTRACT
 
To develop a novel method of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) by coupled dynamic learning of system with Fuzzy logics for minimizing false alarms and security compromise of a system connected with internet. Method: When Intrusion Detection System (IDS) raise alarm based on assigned rules, there would be a possibility for too many false alarms. The degree of intrusion and subsequent alert  are often depending on different situations. These situations are not unique for all systems hence; a global knowledge based filter rules fail to minimize false alarms. To solve this hazy and unclear cutoff rules derived from global knowledge, by self- learning and turning activity of system, towards the security issues from the analytical outcomes of behavioral patterns of network system. The use of fuzzy logic helps to smooth the sharp separation of normal and abnormal behaviors in network activity which adds further strength in minimizing false alarms and security compromise. This concept is illustrated and demonstrated using some familiar network behaviors for easy understanding of logics and mechanism of the proposed IDS model. This intelligence associated with fuzzy logic may be extended with more and more parameters for better efficiency in Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

The term situational awareness is used in military combat operations to denote “the ability to identify, process, and comprehend the critical elements of information about what is happening to the team with regards to the mission”. Network security situational awareness (NSSA) is the ability to assess the current state of a network based on inputs provided by various sensors at different levels of the network. This is quite a challenging task considering the volume of traffic found on any kind of network. The functions of NSSA can be described at four different levels as in:
 
1.1.1 Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), firewall logs, scan reports etc. Analyze the received information for evidences of any threat.Predict future threats based on the information learned from inputs such as IDS, firewall logs, scan reports etc. Recommend remedial actions to address a security event when it happens.

(The Figure should in centre; The Name of the Figure should be written below the Diagram as shown here)
 
 
 
 
In order for the NSSA to function effectively, identification of suspicious activities on a network is of primary importance. Intrusion detection is the process of identifying activities on a network that are violating the security policies of the network. Intrusions affect the integrity, confidentiality of the information on the network and prevent accessibility of the information sources on the network. An IDS with good accuracy will help in better Network Security Situational Awareness (NSSA).
